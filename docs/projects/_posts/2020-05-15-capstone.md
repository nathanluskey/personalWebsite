# A Great Experience!
This was an awesome learning experience thanks in large part to our proefessor [Dr. Stubbs](https://bme.gatech.edu/bme/faculty/James-Stubbs). To arrive at an exciting solution for dental x-rayse, we followed the FDA waterfall to observe and interview doctors, prototype a product, and evaluate doctorâ€™s satisfaction. Our design *literally* flips the problem by having an intraoral source and an extraoral sensor; this allows for a more comfortable patient experience and better pictures for diagnosis. Some of the largest tasks I owned while working on the project were:

- Initial interviews with shaddowing dentists and technicicians
- Creating a requirements workbook
- Running Monte Carlo radiation simulations with [EGSnrc](https://nrc-cnrc.github.io/EGSnrc/)
- Material selection to comply with standards for hot & cold sterilization
- Compiling work from the group for presentations
