# CNC Milling (BMED3801)
This class was a really great experience with [Marty Jacobson](http://martinjacobson.com/id/). We were first introduced to the basics of CNC milling, HSMWorks, and G-code to operate the HAAS CNC milling machine in the [BME Design Shop](https://bme.gatech.edu/bme/bme-design-shop). Once we were familiarized, we started on two hands on projects: a 2D business card & a final, open-ended project. 

## Business Card
For this project, we were provided fixturing and the 3D model. I designed the card in Autodesk and generated the G-code using HSMWorks. Below are some pictures of the model in Fusion & the finished product.

## Final Project
For this project, we worked in teams of 4. My team decided to work on a [miller's cube](https://i.redd.it/cvuzk0n94i541.jpg) with 3 Layers. We made "wedding cakes" to hold the inner cubes in place as the other faces were milled. Below are some pictures of the models for the wedding cakes & the miller's cube; there's also the picture of the finished cube.

Big thanks to my team: Ardy Deshmukh, Ladji Soumahoro, & Will Roden.
Also big thanks to Marty Jacobson & our TA Andy Stevens.
