# I got tired of reloading a page, so I did it the *lazy* way.

Due to Coronavirus, the GT Rec Center (CRC) is requiring [online sign ups](https://mycrc.gatech.edu/Program/GetProducts?classification=1a69ef55-313a-45e5-b068-1a96056ae8d6). The spots are very limited and are posted throughout the day. Instead of constantly reloading the page, I made a notification system. 

I used python to do HTTPS requests and Telegram to send out the notifications easily. Lastly, I uploaded the script to an AWS EC2 instance to run independently of my computer. It was a great way to familiarize myself with [beautifulsoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) for webscraping in python, and now I won't waste time reloading the page anymore!
