# PongAI: Reinforcement Learning to Create Optimal Strategies

To see a full explanation visit my [Github repository](https://github.com/nathanluskey/PongAI). 

Alternatively, visit the [website](https://nathanluskey.github.io/PongAI/) to see the optimal cups to hit at every step of the game.

The reasoning behind doing this project is two fold. One, Pong is *fun* and *relatable*. Two, it's actually a good candidate for using Q-Learning to build out a policy. The state space is fairly limited, so building out a table doesn't get to be ridiculous and games can be played really quickly. Also, rewards are given for hitting a cup rather than ending the game, so training can go much quicker.
