# A Great Intro to Machine Learning

[CS4641](http://mimoralea.github.io/cs4641B-summer2020/) has been a really great experience. The class covers a broad range of introductory ML techniques through lecture which culminate in a large group project. My team worked on using the [Million Song Database](http://millionsongdataset.com/) to look at the feasability of creating taylored running playlists. Some of the largest tasks I owned while working on the project were:
- Combining the SQL database with the genre data into a csv
- Understanding the online example scripts for creating & pruning a decision tree
- Creating strong visuals of the decision tree
- Summarizing the results of the unsupervised and supervised methods

For more info on the project look at [our Github repository](https://github.com/nathanluskey/CS4641_Project).

Big thanks to my team: Reagan Matthews, Dylan Reese, & David Wen.
