# Why use a static site generator? And Why Jekyll Specifically?  

TL;DR: I'm ~~cheap & lazy~~ thrifty & efficient.

## I'm thrify.
This site is hosted on GitHub [here](https://github.com/nilnate/personalWebsite). I'm doing this because it's *free* and *easy*. Changing the contents of the website are as simple as committing and pushing. The domain was bought through Google Domains for $12 (thank god my name isn't John Smith) and linked using this [guide](https://dev.to/trentyang/how-to-setup-google-domain-for-github-pages-1p58) which took ~15 minutes. To compare alternatives for hosting, Squarespace costs $16/month; however, Squarespace is a lot easier than writing your own website from scratch. This brings me to why Jekyll specifically.

## It's easy.
I tried writing a website from scratch, and [it's still on my Github](https://github.com/nilnate/personalWebsite/tree/master/oldDocs/docs). I know a little about HTML/CSS/Javascript, but this quickly became too big a pain for what I had planned... What started as a simple idea to add a few, basic design elements quickly snowballed into semi-incoherent quick fixes. I *needed* a static site generator to simplify everything down, and Github pages already comes with Jekyll! The [setup](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll) is a little much at the start, but it's effortless once everything is setup. Editing pages is done in Markdown, and there are lots of themes that can be very easily [incorporated](https://help.github.com/en/enterprise/2.14/user/articles/adding-a-jekyll-theme-to-your-github-pages-site). This makes Jekyll, in my opinion, as effortless as it get's for free.
